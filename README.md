## Reconnisiance  
1. Starting with rustscan.  
![Rustscan result](./rustscan.png)  
it gave us a few ports so next i will try nmap agressive scan on these ports  

2. Nmap  
![Nmap scan](./nmap.png)  
It gave us a username and password 😂  
well this was easy.  
Let's try to login with these credentials.  

3. SSH  
![ssh](./ssh.png)  
Wow, we are in.  
All that's left is to find the flag in user account and read it.

Done 😁
